# The intricacies of the Multiplayer feature and why it should be integrated into your next game.

Steam's 

## 1. Current Multiplayer applications (or lack thereof)

As I dug into the initial Steam data, it was interesting to see the various applications which exist. The most important information to note was how non-multiplayer games topple the other applications within Steam. When it came to analsying applications with the multiplayer feature, it was intriguing to note that multiplayer DLCs outweigh the multiplayer games altogether. This isn't shocking but wasn't expected. 

DLCs are usually released as an add-on/follow up to many games with either **the multiplayer feature** or extra quests/bonuses. This is usually to keep the players interested in the initial games and introduce them to a set of new refreshing challenges; **what better way to do so than to engage the player with other players**?

## 2. What are the top 30 played games on Steam?

I found this piece to be very astonishing; even if the majority of games on steam are non-multiplayer, yet the highest played games on Steam by Steam users contain the multiplayer option. Out of the top 30 games, only 8 games aren't multiplayer compatible, which means around **73.3% of games** are. This does indicate that **games with the multiplayer option tend to rise in popularity with the players** as it gives them the perfect platform to play, interact, and compete with many others.

## 3. Revisiting Steam from 2014

Let's analyse data from 2014, specifically the months of August and September. I decided to take into account the top 10 countries of that time with the highest Steam users active during those months.

## 4. Steam Matchmaking

Now let's drill down to what these users were playing when the data was retrieved. Many were using the **Steam Matchmaking feature ('Yes') which meant they were playing the multiplayer mode of various games** with _Dota_ 2 being the most popular. Even though _Half-Life 2: Lost Coast_ was shown to be the most popular game on Steam, this resulting analysis does not display it to be the number one most popular for either of those months. This game's counterpart; Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, on the other hand does indeed contain a multiplayer mode and hence is the top playable game for both months.
